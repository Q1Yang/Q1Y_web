      This paper examines whether similarity in social identities between a manager and the board affects executive compensation, firm value, and agency frictions. By using a novel dataset on surnames with multiple identities (native language, native place, and caste), developed by merging micro census data of 474 million Indians  with data from Linguistic Survey of India (LSI), I provide evidence that the firms with a shared group identity between a manager and the board do well compare to other firms. Due to in-group favoritism, managers of such firms earn higher compensation. These results are more substantial for group identity based on native language and native place. I also find that the firm benefits from taking on the cost of in-group favoritism as it reduces the agency frictions and increases firm value in the long run. These results are robust to the endogeneity test, managerial influence on firm,  college ties, ties from past employment, and various other checks.

    An influential emerging literature, led by Bolton and Kacperczyk (2021a), documents strong correlations between unscaled raw emissions and both stock returns and operating performance. We re-examine that data, using a sample of 2,729 U.S. firms from 2005-2019, and conclude that the associations between unscaled emissions and both stock returns and operating performance disappear once we account for firm size, industry clustering of standard errors, and vendor-estimated versus firm-disclosed emissions, both in the U.S. sample and in Europe. Investors might want to be cautious about assuming that carbon emissions are priced by equity markets.

    The theory of sustainable investing proposes that investors are willing to take lower returns because they relish holding green assets, which hedge climate risk by encouraging pro-environmental outcomes. We tested this proposition using a sample of 2,564 green bonds obtained from the Bloomberg Fixed Income database as of December 31, 2020. In the process, we questioned whether (i) green bond investors earn smaller yields, (ii) equity investors react positively to the issuance of green bonds, and (iii) green bonds are associated with reduced carbon emissions. Contrary to the previous work that suffers from sample composition biases, we found that the stock market reaction to the announcement of green bonds is statistically insignificant and that the positive U.S. market reaction reported in previous papers was mainly due to Tesla’s green bonds. In the secondary bond market, green bonds have a lower yield of negative 32 basis points relative to a propensity score-matched sample, a finding primarily attributable to the green bonds issued by the financial sector. Green bonds issued by four polluting sectors – the energy, industrial, material, and utility sectors – are associated with relatively higher yields in the secondary market, while we would have expected investors in such sectors to provide the operators with incentives to improve their environmental footprint. The emissions for issuers of green bonds do not fall even after four years following issuance. Our work raises questions regarding the value of green bonds for both investors and the environment.
