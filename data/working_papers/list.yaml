      This paper examines whether similarity in social identities between a manager and the board affects executive compensation, firm value, and agency frictions. By using a novel dataset on surnames with multiple identities (native language, native place, and caste), developed by merging micro census data of 474 million Indians  with data from Linguistic Survey of India (LSI), I provide evidence that the firms with a shared group identity between a manager and the board do well compare to other firms. Due to in-group favoritism, managers of such firms earn higher compensation. These results are more substantial for group identity based on native language and native place. I also find that the firm benefits from taking on the cost of in-group favoritism as it reduces the agency frictions and increases firm value in the long run. These results are robust to the endogeneity test, managerial influence on firm,  college ties, ties from past employment, and various other checks.

    An influential emerging literature, led by Bolton and Kacperczyk (2021a), documents strong correlations between unscaled raw emissions and both stock returns and operating performance. We re-examine that data, using a sample of 2,729 U.S. firms from 2005-2019, and conclude that the associations between unscaled emissions and both stock returns and operating performance disappear once we account for firm size, industry clustering of standard errors, and vendor-estimated versus firm-disclosed emissions, both in the U.S. sample and in Europe. Investors might want to be cautious about assuming that carbon emissions are priced by equity markets.

    This paper examines three aspects of corporate green bonds – 'how shareholders react to the announcement of green bonds issuance in different countries? 'which firms issue green bonds?', and 'who supports their issuance?' The stylized facts suggest that green bonds issuance is highly concentrated among few firms (and their subsidiaries) in the US and Europe but diversified in the Asian region. On analyzing the market reaction to the announcement of green bonds and alternate green bonds (-social bonds, sustainability bonds, and sustainability-linked bonds) in 19 countries, I find that shareholders are either neutral to the issuance of green bonds or consider it as greenwashing. I also find that firms with low environment scores, low ESG scores, high unscaled carbon emissions, and no target emissions issue more green bonds than others. The latter result supports the signaling hypothesis. Also, only domestic (and not foreign) institutional investors support the issuance of the green bonds, which implies the home-bias effect of domestic investors but the reluctance of foreign investors about this asset class. In sum, the paper suggests it is crucial to understand the intricacies in corporate green bonds issuance to correctly emulate stockholders' reaction, highlight the identity of green bond issuers, and know what kind of institutional investors support the issuance of the green bonds.

      Calls for conscious capitalism have spurred numerous innovations in firm governance. In this study, we assess whether there is a cost to investors for one such innovation—state-level constituency statutes that permit board members to consider the interests of all stakeholders—not just shareholders—when making decisions. As competing demands from stakeholders increase, we argue monitoring by boards will be hampered, resulting in reduced transparency to investors by managers. Using a sample of U.S. publicly traded firms (1981-2010), we observe significant decline in transparency by firms incorporated in states with such statutes. While we find firms experiencing losses use conscious capitalism as an umbrella to remain opaque, firms that need financial markets for capital remain transparent despite such statutes. Our paper contributes to the debate on the ‘objective of the firm’ by showing that adopting stakeholder governance without addressing its challenges may lead to managerial entrenchment and affect transparency negatively.

      Do changes in the IPO regulatory environment affect private firms’ exit choices, bargaining abilities, and valuations? Using the JOBS Act as an exogenous shock to the exit decisions among private firms, we observe that their valuations as M&A targets increase after the Act, negatively affecting acquirer wealth gains. These results are more prominent for VC-backed targets. We also find that stock (cash) deals decrease (increase) for private firms after the Act. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns, sampling bias, alternative measures, placebo tests, merger waves, and various other vigorous checks.

      This paper examines the type of firm culture which leads to corporate misconduct activities. Using the management's tone in the 10-K report as a proxy for culture,  we find that higher internal “compete” culture (or tournament culture) increases  corporate misconduct activities such as restatements, earnings management, and accounting fraud by increasing the firm risk.The results are robust to external validity tests, firm-specific systematic risk, market competition, governance characteristics, CEO effects, and endogeneity concerns.

      This paper examines how debt markets price firms' Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, in a setting where it is  not a strategic choice but rather mandated by regulation. Using both a difference-in-difference and a regression discontinuity empirical specification, the paper reports that binding CSR rule increase yield-spreads on bonds by 22 basis points.  Firms with a business group affiliation show a reduction in yield spreads and state-owned companies an  increase in yield-spreads. The increase in yield-spreads is mitigated by good governance with well governed firms having lower yield-spreads. These findings add to the contribution of Manchiraju and Rajgopal (2017), which reports that such mandatory rules are detrimental to stockholders’ wealth.
